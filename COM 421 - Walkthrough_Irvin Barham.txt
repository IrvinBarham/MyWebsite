	For this project, I made 3 web pages: homepage, projects, and random photography. 
The large black heading found at the top of the page contains navigation to all of these webpages, 
and it also includes my basic contact information, as well as my Github page.
In comparison to my resume, the about me section on the homepage is a bit more detailed and lengthy.
I generally kept most of the information the same, for everything else.
In my projects page, I made the project descriptions more stylistic and cohesive in their delivery to the viewer.
There you can find my 3 main projects listed on Github. My last page, random photography, is a collection of photos I’ve taken in IL.
They’re laid out in a vertical strip, for easy viewing as they’re only a few of them. 



	Looking back, I wish I could’ve added a better picture viewing function. 
The scrolling could get tedious if I wanted to add more pictures to the website.
If I had more time, I would’ve made a set of arrow buttons to view pictures one at a time (like a slideshow).
I also would’ve added more projects too, and the homepage could hold more information too (use sections from my resume more).
I also would’ve put a picture of myself somewhere on the homepage -- perhaps in a different background color -- if I had more time.
